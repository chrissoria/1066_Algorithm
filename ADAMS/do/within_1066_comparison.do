/*\
The challenge though is that we don't have all of the same variables in ADAMS to create cogscore and relscore. \
The attached file hrs1066_adams_20230616.do has the code that was used to try to create in 10/66 new versions of cogscore and relscore that only used the variables that exist in both datasets. \
Can you please look at this file and see if the way they constructed these indices is consistent with the full 10/66 algorithm for constructing cogscore and relscore \
(but again we could just drop the missings if those are problematic).\
\
Notes from Chris:\
I'm finding that there are disability adjustments in ADAMS \
I'm finding that some variables excluded in this do file are in the ADAMS (Informant) (kept)\
If I use the other one that might be the correct (CLINICAL HISTORY FIRST INFORMANT) there is also some variables in there that aren't here (hobby)\
In the cognitive test, I found recall (which will be an important part of this algorithm later on)\
Story might be a different length in ADAMS\
Some of these variables are in different scales (for example, the toilet variable). \
We don't have recall in the ADAMS\
